Project Title :
   Papollo Hospitals: Patient Leads Flow & Operational Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive view of hospital operations, covering patient flow, billing, doctor feedback, and diagnosis insights. It empowers stakeholders to monitor performance, identify patterns, and make data-driven decisions to enhance hospital services.

Tech Stack

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.
• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.
• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.
• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

🎯 Project Objective

Hospitals often face challenges in managing patient data, streamlining operations, and improving service quality due to fragmented systems and lack of real-time insights. This dashboard was developed to solve those pain points with:

-Centralized operational and diagnostic analytics
-Visual cues for performance monitoring
-Actionable insights for hospital management

📈 Key Visuals & Features

-🗓 Patient Timeline Cards: Shows Admit Date, Discharge Date, Follow-up Date, and Total Bill Amount
-🛏 Bed Occupancy: Bar chart displaying Private, General, and ICU bed usage
-👨‍⚕️ Doctor Feedback Volume: Donut chart highlighting patient feedback for each doctor
-🩺 Diagnosis-wise Patient Count: Horizontal bar chart for top patient diagnoses (e.g., Viral Infection, Flu, Malaria)
-💰 Billing vs Health Insurance: Line chart comparing billed amounts vs. health insurance coverage for various services

💡 Business Impact & Insights
-🔍 Viral Infections are the most common diagnosis – helps with resource planning
-🛏 Private beds are in highest demand – indicates patient preference or financial segmentation
-💳 Health insurance covers less than billed amounts – suggests financial planning or insurance gaps
-🌟 Uniform doctor feedback – reflects consistent service quality across departments
